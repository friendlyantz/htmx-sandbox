# Action Plan and Contents

> You need some server to handge htmx request.
> I started with basic VSCode live server, then switched to more manual Ruby Rack and then Sinatra for a bit more advanced stuff.

- [*] ROOT DIR: Try simple HTMX with basic live server from VSCode or similar(all files are located on the ROOT level)
- [*] RACK DIR: Ruby Rack app to handle basic GET, POST HTMX requests -> Refer readme there OR `cd` into it and type `make` to refer Makefile options
- [] SINATRA DIRs: Ruby Sinatra app to have some nice UI and handle requests such as POST, DELETE, etc -> `cd` into it and type `make` to refer Makefile options
